# 4.1.1 – Parsing
[w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html)


## Description

Parsing is the way software like web browsers and assistive technology read and understand a website.
Parsing is all about your website’s code.

Bad or broken HTML is more likely to cause parsing problems for assistive technology.


## Success criteria

This is a wide-ranging guideline, one that changes with time as standards evolve.

Here are the most common issues to watch out for:
*   Ensure HTML elements have complete start ( &lt; > ) and end ( &lt;/ > ) tags where needed.
*   Nest all HTML elements correctly (for example, list objects within an ordered or unordered list).
*   Use unique Ids.
*   Check that HTML elements don’t contain duplicate attributes.

## Advantages of implementation

:::note [washington.edu](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/checklist/validation/)

*   Validating mark-up can help in your debugging efforts if your web page exhibits unexpected problems.
*   Valid mark-up provides a better cross-browser, cross-platform, experience and gives you maximum control over how your page is displayed.
*   Valid mark-up will help with future compatibility as it will have the best chance of being backward-compatible with new technologies.
*   Properly formed HTML renders faster than HTML with errors. This means less load on servers and client browsers.
*   A site that validates using proper HTML is a sign of professionalism.
