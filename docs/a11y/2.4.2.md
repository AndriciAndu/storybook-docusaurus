*   etc.

## Tips

*   A **useful format** for writing page titles is: ‘Page name – Page description – Website name’
( ‘About Us – Learn our Secrets – ACME Corp’).
*   If pages are **part of a process**, such as a checkout, use the title to tell the user what stage they’re at
(‘Checkout – Page 1 of 5 – ACME Corp’).
*   Don’t forget **dynamic pages** such as search results (‘Search Results for XXXX’)
and **404 errors** (Sorry, we can’t find that page).
*   In many cases, it makes sense to repeat the page title, or a variation of it,
as the top heading on your page.
*   Type your page titles into a spreadsheet and review them. If they make sense out of context,
they will work on your website.
*   Use these page titles in your **sitemap** to make it more accessible.

You'll want to have a **consistent naming convention** across your page titles.
How exactly you organize the information, what separators you use, etc. are totally up to you.
Just make sure your titles as clear, descriptive, and brief as possible.

Examples:
*   A page title with the most important information first. The title of the page first identifies
the topic of the page, then is followed by the name of the parent organization or company.

*   A page title divided into several parts. A web page provides guidelines and suggestions for
creating closed captions. This example uses the organization, then the section of the site that
the web page belongs, then the web page title itself. Similar to Example 1, both are compliant.
