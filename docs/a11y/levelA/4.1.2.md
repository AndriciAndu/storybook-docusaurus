## Description

Any **custom** code (elements, components, widgets, etc) must conform to the HTML standards. <br />
_This does not apply to **standard HTML controls (elements)**, as they already meet this success criterion
(when used according to specification)._

*   Conforming to HTML standards require that:
    *   `name` and `value` can be [programmatically determined][programmatically_determined_url]
    *   `states`, `properties`, and `values`, that can be set by the user, can be
        [programmatically set][programmatically_set_url]
*   Conforming to HTML standards ensure that the necessary data:
    *   **is correctly exposed** to [User Agents][user_agents_url] (including [assistive technoloy][assistive_technoloy_url])
    *   **can be correctly modified** by the user through the User Agent itself.


## Definition of parts

### Role

**[Definition:](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#roledef)**
main indicator of type. This semantic association allows tools to present
and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations
about other objects of that type.

**The `role` does not ever change for an element once it is set.**

Examples:
*   **`role="menu"`**, for a custom `Dropdown Menu`;
*   **`role="search"`**, for a `Input` which handles searching within the application;
*   **`role="presentation"`**, for an element that is purely presentational, such as a `Svg Icon`;
*   [See WAI-ARIA Roles on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)


### Name

**[Definition:](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html#namedef)**
text by which software can identify a component to the user

_**Note 1:** The `name` may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology,
whereas a `label` is presented to all users.
In many (but not all) cases, the `label` and the `name` are the same._
_**Note 2:** This is **unrelated** to the name attribute in HTML._


### Property

**[Definition:](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-property)**
represents data associated with an Object/Element.

_The change of a property may significantly impact the meaning or presentation of an object._


### State

**[Definition:](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-state)**
represents a **dynamic property** expressing characteristics of an Object/Element, that
may change in response to user action or automated processes.

_States do not affect the essential nature of the object, but represent data associated with
the object or user interaction possibilities._


Examples of `properties` that define a `state`:
*   **`aria-checked`**: `true` || `false`, for a `Checkbox`;
*   **`aria-expanded`**: `true` || `false`, for a `Select`;
*   **`aria-invalid`**: `true` || `false`, for a `Input`;
