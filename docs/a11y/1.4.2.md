# 1.4.2 â€“ Audio Control

## Description:

*   Users that rely on screen reading software, rely on sound. Audio that plays in the background interferes with this.
_Even more so if there is no way to adjust the volume of the background audio from the general system volume._
*   Also, even with controls that allow changing the volume, when audio is playing, it might be difficult for
users that rely on screen reading software to be able to identify and access those controls.


## Success criteria:

**Note:**
all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria)
must meet this success criterion.

A mechanism is provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust volume for audio that automatically
plays on a page for more than 3 seconds.

:::

* Don't play audio automatically. **(or)**
* Don't play audio automatically, that last longer than 3 seconds. **(or)**
* Provide audio controls that:
  * are easy to identify and access (clearly visible, at the start of the page, and at the start of the focus order)
  * are independent of the general system volume
  * permit both adjusting the volume and turning it completely off


## Advantages of implementation

---

*   **Not Annoying Your Users:**
It's jarring to load a site that begins with blaring audio you weren't expecting.
Users perceive it as aggressive, obnoxious, and intrusive.
*   **Reducing Bounce Rate:**
Autoplayed sound triggers a knee-jerk reaction to turn it off, which often means your
audience closing the tab right away and leaving the site completely.
*   **Reducing Page Load Times:**
Pages with autoplay media content can often experience slower performance, especially on mobile devices.
*   **Reducing Bandwidth:**
Autoplay will consume additional bandwidth, and if you host media using a service like Amazon S3
that has a bandwidth quota, you may end up paying more money, unnecessarily.
